# 2-6-21-Homework
# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This is a portfolio page to display my (Elise Daly's) deployed web applications. I currently have none, so all of the content here is currently filler.

You can view the portfolio page [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/2-6-21-Homework/).


## Usage

Click one of the four links at the top right of the page to be brought down to the appropriate section.

Click the image cards in the "Work" section to be brought to that application's page (currently, these are placeholder links.)

Click the link in the "Resume" section to download Elise's resume (currently just a .pdf of an image of a panda).
